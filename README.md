# Make Change

### Overview

In this project, I was tasked with creating a facsimile cash register where a customer would provide both the price of the item and how much cash they had on hand.  The program had to meet the following criteria:

User Story #1
The user is prompted asking for the price of the item.

User Story #2
The user is then prompted asking how much money was tendered by the customer.

User Story #3
Display an appropriate message if the customer provided too little money or the exact amount.

User Story #4
If the amount tendered is more than the cost of the item, display the number of bills and coins that should be given to the customer.

### How to Use

Please feel free to either review my source code by hand or run through your preferred IDE.  This has been tested via Eclipse.

### Technologies

* Conditionals
* Modulus Operator

### Lessons Learned
I found this first homework to be challenging for a couple of reasons, I don't think that integers and particularly doubles are well suited to financial operations; however, with a week of our bootcamp under our belts these were the two types of variables that I selected to work with.  Initially, all of my variables were provided as doubles and then for currency I casted to integers as needed.  When displaying how many of a certain denomination of currency it worked well.  The biggest challenge to using all variables as doubles I discovered was a lack of precision when rounding.  I would be off by a penny in several of our user stories.  

I have also learned that it may be easier to whiteboard ahead of time and detail all classes, methods, and variables.  I chose to only complete the program with use of the main class.  No additional classes or methods were created.  In retrospect, I would have chosen a simpler naming convention for variables as well.  

I am overall pleased with the progress that I have made to this point as prior to starting the bootcamp I had had no coding experience.  I look forward to being able to complete similar projects in the future with a more honed instinct for how to efficiently write a longer program, debug more effectively, and test against use cases/user stories.  

I hope you enjoy my first coding project!
